Summary: The purpose of this data set was to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and create a tidy data set. The original data set was collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone where 30 subjects performed 6 different activities. The the training and testing data sets were assembled as one and the mean and standard deviation for all measurements were extracted. The presenting data set was calculated by taking the average of observations group by the subject and activity from the extracted data set of means and standard deviations.

This repo contains the following file:

- "README.md"

- "CodeBook.md": Description of tidy dataset, its variables, and transformations performed

- "run_Analysis.R": Analysis to assemble, organize, and produce the tidy data set "average_mean_std_summary.txt"

- "average_mean_std_summary.txt": Tidy data set that displays the mean of the mean and standard deviations of the observations collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone data set grouped by subject and activity.
